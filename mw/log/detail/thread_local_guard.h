/// \brief RAII Pattern to manipulate thread-local variable, to indicate if we are within logging stack or not
///
/// \details Whenever we call a complex recorder, it could happen that this complex recorder uses common libraries that
///  on the other side again use logging. This would lead to a recursive call stack - ending in a crash of an
///  application. The idea is the following, that we figure if a logging command has been called within a complex
///  recorder. We can do this by relying on the stack - meaning, we have to-do this per thread, since each thread has a
///  custom stack. For that, we utilize a thread-local variable. For each call to a recorder, we mark this as true, once
///  the call left, we mark it as false. This way we are also able to support recursive calls to logging within the user
///  space. Whenever we then are logging in the logging stack, we need to fallback to a simpler recorder (e.g. console)
///  which does not rely on any common libraries (like e.g. lib/memory/shared).
